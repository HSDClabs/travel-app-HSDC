# Everyday is a Saturday
Welcome to our Tourism App! Where we think everyday should be a Saturday. This app is designed to help you plan your next vacation and explore the world. We like to think that a great day consits of 6 core pillars.

* A good cup of coffee
* A sunny stroll in a park
* An activity to get your blood pumping
* A nice meal cooked by regional chefs
* A drink to take the edge off
* A comedy show to let loose

Our philsophy is that when visiting a new city this is the best way to have a good day. Our app enables you to plan the best vacation without planning ahead, no need to spend hours on your computer.
